%	Ebenezum walked before me along the closest thing we could
%	find to a path in these overgrown woods.  Every few paces he
%	would pause, so that I, burdened with a pack stuffed with
%	arcane and heavy paraphernalia, could catch up with his
%	wizardly strides.  He, as usual, carried nothing, preferring,
%	as he often said, to keep his hands free for quick conjuring
%	and his mind free for the thoughts of a mage.
	Ebenezum は我々がこれらの育ち過ぎた森で見いだした道の，最も
	近いものに沿って私の前を歩いていた． 数歩歩く度に彼は一休み
	しなければならなかったので，それで私は，神秘的で重い道具一式
	が詰まった袋を重荷に思いつつも，彼の驚くべき歩幅に追いつく事
	ができた．彼は，いつものように，好んで，彼がしばしば言ってい
	るように，素早く魔法をかける為と魔法の瞑想において思考を自由
	にする為に，何も運ばなかった．
