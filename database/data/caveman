%	Now it was light enough to leave.  Moon-Watcher picked up
%	the shriveled corpse and dragged it after him as he bent
%	under the low overhang of the cave.  Once outside, he
%	threw the body over his shoulder and stood upright - the
%	only animal in all this world able to do so.
%	Among his kind, Moon-Watcher was almost a giant.  He was
%	nearly five feet high, and though badly undernourished
%	weighed over a hundred pounds.  His hairy, muscular body
%	was halfway between ape and man, but his head was already
%	much nearer to man than ape.  The forehead was low, and
%	there were ridges over the eye sockets, yet he unmistakably
%	held in his genes the promise of humanity.
	今や，去るのに充分な明るさだった．ムーンウォッチャーはしぼんだ死
	体を拾い上げ，洞穴の低い張り出しの下で背をかがめながら，それを自
	分の後ろに引きずった．一度外に出て，彼は身体を肩の上から投げ出し，
	そしてまっすぐに立った――この世界においてそれ（直立）が出来る唯
	一の動物として．
	彼の種族において，ムーンウォッチャーはほとんど巨人だった．彼の背
	丈は約５フィートあり，そしてひどく栄養不良とはいえ体重は１００ポ
	ンド以上あった．彼の毛深い筋肉の体は猿と人間の中間であったが，彼
	の頭部は既に猿より人間にずっと近いものであった．額は低く，眼窩の
	上にうねがあり，紛れも無く彼の遺伝子には人間の兆候がみられた．
