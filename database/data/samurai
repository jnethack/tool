%	By that time, Narahara had already slipped his arm from the
%	sleeve of his outer robe, drew out his two-and-a-half-foot
%	Fujiwara Tadahiro sword, and, brandishing it over his head,
%	began barreling toward the foreigners.  In less than a minute,
%	he had charged upon them and cut one of them through the torso.
%	The man fled, clutching his bulging guts, finally to fall from
%	his horse at the foot of a pine tree about a thousand yards
%	away.  Kaeda Takeji finished him off.  The other two Englishmen
%	were severely wounded as they tried to flee.  Only the woman
%	managed to escape virtually unscathed.

	そのときには奈良原が大剣をひねりあげて地を蹴り，駆けながら肩衣を
	はねあげていた．
	  奈良原が，二尺五寸藤原忠広をもって馬上の異人の左胴から腹にかけ
	て斬りさげていたのは，それから一分もたたぬのちである．この男はは
	み出てくる腸をおさえながら逃げ，十丁ほどむこうの松の根方にころげ
	落ち，海江田武次にトドメをさされた．他の二人もそれぞれ一刀を浴び
	て遁走し，女ひとりだけはたすかった．
